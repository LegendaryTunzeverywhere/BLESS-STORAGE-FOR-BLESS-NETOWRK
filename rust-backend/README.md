# Rust Backend

This directory contains the Rust-based backend services for the Bless decentralized storage application. This backend likely handles core logic, potentially interacting with IPFS or other low-level storage mechanisms, and may be compiled to WebAssembly for use in other parts of the system.

## Usage

- **Core Logic**: Implements critical backend functionalities.
- **High Performance**: Leverages Rust for performance-critical operations.
- **WebAssembly Compilation**: Can be compiled to `.wasm` for use in environments like Node.js or browsers.

## Properties

- **Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock**: Rust project manifest and lock file.
- **src/**: Contains the Rust source code.
- **IPFS Integration**: Likely interacts with IPFS for decentralized storage.
