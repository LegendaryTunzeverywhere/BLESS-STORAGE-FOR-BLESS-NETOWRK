# HTTP Proxy IPFS Cache

This directory serves as a local cache for content retrieved from IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) by the HTTP proxy service. Caching IPFS content locally helps improve performance and reduce redundant network requests.

## Usage

- **Content Caching**: Stores frequently accessed IPFS files to speed up retrieval.
- **Offline Access**: May enable limited offline access to cached content.

## Properties

- **Temporary Storage**: Content in this cache can be cleared periodically.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces latency for IPFS content delivery.
